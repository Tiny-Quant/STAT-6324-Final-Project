# STAT-6324-Final-Project

Heart Disease Risk Assessment: A Data Driven Approach by Art Tay and Delaney Helgeson

Note: In order to use the the shiny app `app.r` you must run `6324xbg.qmd` first to create an rds object of the final model. (It was too large to upload here)
Note: Data CSV is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/andls555/heart-disease-prediction/notebook).
